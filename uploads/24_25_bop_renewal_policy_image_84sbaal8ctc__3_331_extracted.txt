[TEXT] But if Earth Movement, as described in Paragraphs (1) through (4) above, results in fire or explosion damage to Covered Property, we will pay for the physical loss or physical damage to Covered Property caused by that fire or explosion. (5) Volcanic eruption, explosion or effusion. But if volcanic eruption, explosion or effusion results in fire or volcanic action damage to Covered Property, we will pay for the physical loss or physical damage caused by that fire or volcanic action. Volcanic action means direct physical loss or direct physical damage resulting from the eruption of a volcano when the direct physical loss or direct physical damage is caused by: (a) Airborne volcanic blast or airborne shock waves; (b) Ash, dust, or particulate matter; or (c) Lava flow. With respect to coverage for volcanic action as set forth in 5(a) through 5(c) above, all volcanic eruptions that occur within any 168-hour period will constitute a single occurrence. Volcanic action does not include the cost to remove ash, dust, or particulate matter that does not cause direct physical loss or direct physical damage to Covered Property. This Exclusion applies regardless of whether any of the above, in Paragraphs (1) through (5), is caused by weather, an act of nature or by an artificial, man-made or other cause. b. Governmental Action Seizure or destruction of property by order of governmental authority. But we will pay for direct physical loss or direct physical damage to Covered Property caused by or resulting from acts of destruction ordered by governmental authority and taken at the time of a fire to prevent its spread, if the fire would be covered under this Coverage Part. c.

This includes, but is not limited to, the release, dispersal or application of radioactive material, or the use of a nuclear weapon or device that involves or produces a nuclear reaction, nuclear radiation or radioactive contamination or radioactive force. (2) When state standard fire policy law requires that we cover any resulting fire damage, we will pay only for the resulting damage to Covered Property caused by that resulting fire, if the fire would be covered under this Coverage Part. We will pay only the actual cash value for the damaged property. Therefore, we will not pay for any indirect or related loss(es), such as Business Income, Extra Expense, legal liability, or leasehold interest loss(es). d. Utility Services The failure of “communication supply services”, “power supply services”, “wastewater removal services”, “water supply services” or other utility service supplied to the "scheduled premises", however caused, if the failure: (1) Originates away from the “scheduled premises”; or (2) Originates at the “scheduled premises” but only if such failure involves equipment used to supply the utility service to the “scheduled premises” from a source away from the “scheduled premises”. Failure of any utility service includes lack of sufficient capacity and reduction in supply necessary to maintain normal “operations”. But if physical loss or physical damage to Covered Property by a Covered Cause of Loss results, we will pay for that resulting physical loss or physical damage. e. War and Military Action (1) War, including undeclared or civil war; (2) Hostile or warlike action, in time of peace or war, including action in hindering, combating or defending against an actual or expected attack, by any of the following: Form SP 00 00 10 18 Page 4 of 19 © 2018, The Hartford (May include copyrighted material of Insurance Services Office, Inc., with its permission)

In the event you elect to have loss or damage settled on an actual cash value basis, you may still make a claim on a replacement cost basis if you notify us of your intent to do so within 180 days after the physical loss or physical damage. (b) We will not pay on a replacement cost basis for any loss or damage: (i) Until the lost or damaged property is actually repaired or replaced; and (ii) Unless the repairs or replacement are made as soon as reasonably possible after the loss or physical damage. However, if the cost to repair or replace the damaged property is $2,500 or less, we will settle the loss according to the provisions of Paragraph d.(1)(a) above whether or not the actual repair or replacement is complete.

(2) If the Actual Cash Value - Buildings option applies, as shown in the Declarations, Paragraph (1) above does not apply to Buildings. Instead, we will determine the value of Buildings at actual cash value. (3) The following property at actual cash value: (a) Manuscripts; (b) Works of art, antiques or rare articles, including etchings, pictures, statuary, objects of marble, bronzes, porcelains and bric-a-brac; (c) Household contents, except personal property in apartments or rooms furnished by you as landlord; (d) Used or secondhand merchandise held in storage or for sale; and (e) Property of others. However, if an item(s) of personal property of others is subject to a written contract which governs your liability for loss or damage to that item(s), then valuation of that item(s) will be based on the amount for which you are liable under such contract, but not to exceed the lesser of the replacement cost of the property or the applicable Limit of Insurance. (4) Glass at the cost of replacement with safety glazing material if required by law. (5) “Tenant improvements and betterments” at: (a) Replacement cost if you make repairs promptly. (b) A proportion of your original cost if you do not make repairs promptly. We will determine the proportionate value as follows: (i) Multiply the original cost by the number of days from the loss or damage to the expiration of the lease; and (ii) Divide the amount determined in (i) above by the number of days from the installation of improvements to the expiration of the lease. Example: The original cost of the “tenant improvements and betterments” was $100,000. The number of days between the date the damage occurred and the expiration of the lease is 200. The number of days between the installation of the “tenant improvements and betterments” and the expiration of the lease is 500. The proportionate value is: ($100,000 x 200) divided by 500 = $40,000 If your lease contains a renewal option, the expiration of the renewal option period will replace the expiration of the lease in this procedure. (c) Nothing, if others pay for repairs or replacement. (6) "Valuable papers and records", at your incurred cost of: (a) Blank materials for reproducing the records (including blank prepackaged programs when replaced); and (b) Labor to transcribe or copy the records and to research, replace or restore the lost information, including research and development documentation. To the extent “valuable papers and records” are not replaced or restored, the loss will be valued at the cost of replacement of the media on which the "valuable papers and records" were stored, with blank media of substantially identical type. (7) "Money" and "securities": (a) "Money" at its face value; and (b) "Securities" at their value at the close of business on the day the loss is discovered.

(5) Examples Example 1 Limit of Insurance $ 90,000 Amount of Deductible $ 500 Amount of Loss $ 50,000 Amount of Loss Payable $ 49,500 ($50,000 – $500) Debris Removal Expense $ 10,000 Debris Removal Expense Payable $ 10,000 ($10,000 is 20% of $50,000) The debris removal expense is less than 25% of the sum of the loss payable plus the Deductible. The sum of the loss payable and the debris removal expense ($49,500 + $10,000 = $59,500) is less than the Limit of Insurance. Therefore, the full amount of debris removal expense is payable in accordance with the terms of Paragraph (3). Example 2 Limit of Insurance $ 90,000 Amount of Deductible $ 500 Amount of Loss $ 80,000 Amount of Loss Payable $ 79,500 ($80,000 – $500) Debris Removal Expense $ 40,000 Debris Removal Expense Payable Basic Amount $ 10,500 Additional Limit $ 25,000 The basic amount payable for debris removal expense under the terms of Paragraph (3) is calculated as follows: $80,000 ($79,500 + $500) x .25 = $20,000; capped at $10,500. The cap applies because the sum of the loss payable ($79,500) and the basic amount payable for debris removal expense ($10,500) cannot exceed the Limit of Insurance ($90,000). The additional amount payable for debris removal expense is provided in accordance with the terms of Paragraph (4), because the debris removal expense ($40,000) exceeds 25% of the loss payable plus the Deductible ($40,000 is 50% of $80,000), and because the sum of the loss payable and debris removal expense ($79,500 + $40,000 = $119,500) would exceed the Limit of Insurance ($90,000). In this example, the Debris Removal – Additional Limit shown in the Declarations is $25,000. Thus, the total payable for debris removal expense in this example is $35,500; $4,500 of the debris removal expense is not covered.

Step 1: Determine the proportion that the covered direct physical damage bears to the total direct physical damage. $30,000 divided by $100,000 = .30 Step 2: Apply that proportion to the Ordinance or Law loss. $60,000 x .30 = $18,000 In this example, the most we will pay under this endorsement for the Increased Cost of Construction coverage is $18,000, subject to the applicable Limit of Insurance and any other applicable provisions. NOTE: The same procedure applies to losses under Undamaged Part and Demolition Cost coverage of this endorsement.

We will share the remaining loss, if any, with any other insurance that is not described in this Excess Insurance provision and was not bought specifically to apply in excess of the Limits of Insurance shown in the Declarations of this Coverage Part. c. Method Of Sharing If all the other insurance permits contribution by equal shares, we will follow this method also. Under this approach, each insurer contributes equal amounts until it has paid its applicable limit of insurance or none of the loss remains, whichever comes first.

We will pay any return premium to the first named insured. 2. If valid and collectible insurance is available for a "loss" we cover under this Coverage Part, we will share with that other insurance.

Under this approach each insurer contributes by equal amounts until it has paid its applicable limit of insurance or none of the "loss" remains, whichever comes first. If the other insurance does not permit contribution by equal shares, we will contribute by limits. Under this method, each insurer's share is based on the ratio of its applicable limit of insurance to the total applicable limits of insurance of all insurers. 3. If you refuse to consent to a settlement or compromise recommended by us and elect to contest the "data breach claim", our liability shall not exceed the amount for which we would have been liable for "loss" if the "data breach claim" had been so settled when and as so recommended, (minus any applicable deductible) and we shall have the right to withdraw from the further defense of the "data breach claim" by tendering control of the defense thereof to you. 4. Immediately upon discovery of a "data breach", you must take all reasonable steps to mitigate potential damages to third parties by providing reasonable and necessary notification, monitoring and other services, as directed through our designated third party provider or by a third party provider that is approved by us. 5. Our obligation to pay "loss" will only be in excess of the applicable deductible as stated in the Coverage Part Declarations. H. BASIC EXTENDED REPORTING PERIOD We will automatically provide a Basic Extended Reporting Period if this Coverage Part is: 1. Cancelled; 2. Non-renewed; or 3. Renewed by us with insurance that does not apply on a claims made or claims made and reported basis.

Under this provision, you have 30 days after the end of the "policy period" to report to us in writing "data breach claims" first made against any of you during the "policy period". The Basic Extended Reporting Period will not reinstate or increase the Limits of Insurance. I. SUPPLEMENTAL EXTENDED REPORTING PERIOD A Supplemental Extended Reporting Period is available, but only by an endorsement and for an extra charge. This supplemental period, if purchased, will run concurrently with the automatic Extended Reporting Period set forth in paragraph H. above. You must give us a written request for the endorsement within 30 days after the end of the "policy period". The Supplemental Extended Reporting Period will not go into effect unless you pay the additional premium promptly when due.

No Deductible shall apply to "loss" incurred by any "insured person" that an "insured entity” is not permitted by common or statutory law to indemnify, or is permitted or required to indemnify, but is not able to do so by reason of "financial insolvency”. If an "insured entity” is permitted or required by common or statutory law to indemnify an "insured person" for any "loss", or to advance "claim expenses” on their behalf, and does not do so other than because of "financial insolvency", then such "insured entity” and the "named insured” shall reimburse and hold us harmless for our payment or advancement of such "loss" up to the amount of the Deductible that would have applied if such indemnification had been made. If a "subsidiary" is unable to indemnify an "insured person” for any "loss", or to advance "claim expenses” on their behalf, because of "financial insolvency”, then the "named insured” shall reimburse and hold us harmless for our payment or advancement of such "loss" up to the amount of the applicable Deductible that would have applied if such indemnification had been made. The Limit of Liability for this Coverage Part applies separately to each consecutive annual period and to any remaining period of less than twelve (12) months starting with the beginning of the "policy period” shown in the Declarations, unless the "policy period” is extended after issuance for an additional period of less than twelve (12) months. In that case, the additional period will be deemed part of the last preceding period for purposes of determining the Limit of Liability.
